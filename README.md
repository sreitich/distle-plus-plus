# Distle++

An online word-guessing web game made with React. Players are given the Damerau-Levenshtein distance transformations between each of their guesses and the secret word.

The web app is hosted on Firebase, which is also used for user authentication and storage of a "leaderboard" database. At the end of each game, the Webster API is used to display the definition of the secret word.
